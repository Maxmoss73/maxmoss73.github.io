        <p>I can feel myself</p>
        <p>As I am: permeable.</p>
        <p>Ideas and such—</p>
        <p>I let them all in</p>
        <p>Indiscriminately.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I become the city—</p>
        <p>The hustle and bustle;</p>
        <p>Everything seeping in:</p>
        <p>Cultures, opinions, crusades,</p>
        <p>All mashing around</p>
        <p>Making a massive whirlwind in my belly.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It's where I come from, and it makes me sick</p>
        <p>Indeed, it itself <span class="underline-text">is</span> sickness.</p>
        <p>Spreading rhizomatically</p>
        <p>It takes my left arm first:</p>
        <p>To dissipate all thresholds,</p>
        <p>Limitation, judgement.</p>
        <p>I lose the will to fight off sin</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It's so easy to be unclean:</p>
        <p>You don't need to give it food</p>
        <p>For it to be fed—nor is there any upkeep</p>
        <p>To attend to. It's ancient knowledge</p>
        <p>That dragons only grow unchecked;</p>
        <p>That cancer is deemed inoperable</p>
        <p>Only when discovered late.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>So then becomes my project clear:</p>
        <p>To grow this thing inside my gut</p>
        <p>And show it off for all to see</p>
        <p>Saying "This thing that grew inside of me</p>
        <p>Is knocking at your door as well!"</p>
