        <p>How fucking pathetic: A beautiful mind like mine.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The wind is overwhelming.</p>
        <p>It's not me, but at the same time it is.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I woke up to find that my legs were wet concrete.</p>
        <p>I didn't panic; my only reaction was a defeated crumpling.</p>
        <p>I felt like crying, but all I did was contort my face.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Got out of the city, still the fucking same.</p>
        <p>How funny it is to not reply to emails that I myself prompted!</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I built this house.</p>
        <p>It'll outlast me for certain:</p>
        <p>The same pace of rot erodes the body far sooner</p>
        <p>Than it does these floorboards.</p>
        <p>You may not be able to see it</p>
        <p>Even in ten years' time, but of course it's there.</p>
        <p>On me, though, one bad week</p>
        <p>And I wear it like makeup.</p>
