        <p>The Harlot, triple-hour, at her own face gazing</p>
        <p>Annihilating imperfections with cold disdain.</p>
        <p>And in all of this, where's the F'ool? he's playing video games</p>
        <p>And hoping that The Harlot is swoon by clever phrasing.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>If I could one thing, the Harlot, tell—before she were to bed—</p>
        <p>I'd tell her Aphrodite was only briefly wed.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>And if, give I, the Fool advice—coming from a friend—</p>
        <p>It'd be to straighten out and put his whinging to an end.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>...</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>But with bated breath awaiting, he, the seer with clouded mind</p>
        <p>Seeks he obtain the scarlet, but loath he is to find:</p>
        <p>For loathsome all the same is the world to his eyne</p>
        <p>And in truth, the lady hath no gifts divine.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In truth, the Harlot is, and forever will be:</p>
        <p>No more to him than an image on a screen.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>And yet has she the power to coax from him a scream—</p>
        <p>For God's sake, straighten out, man, and wake from this dream!</p>
